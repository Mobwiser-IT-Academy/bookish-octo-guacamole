        <h1>Conflict in Syria</h1>
    </section>

    <p>Humanitarian info details</p>
    <p>What began as a response to peaceful protest in 2011 quickly became a protracted conflict and a complex humanitarian crisis. An exodus of 5.5 million refugees has ensued, along with over 6 million Syrians displaced within the country. As of December, 2020, 13 million Syrians still in-country are in need of humanitarian assistance, including 4.8 million children. The European Commission Joint Research Centre’s INFORM Severity Index ranks Syria as the most severe humanitarian crisis as of December, 2020.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><a href="#">1 Increased conflict leading to additional displacement and instability</a></li>
            <li><a href="#">2 Declining value of the Syrian Pound, which has inflated food prices and increased levels of food insecurity</a></li>
            <li><a href="#">3 COVID-19 has closed borders, limiting both the work we can do and the ways we can measure the work we have done. Fortunately, we have been able to focus on one of the key areas of prevention in this pandemic, WASH.</a></li>

                <p>Working with partners, we plan to rehabilitate five more water stations and four water networks, and provide chlorination to 20 water stations to help provide more options for safe drinking water. Combined, these activities would reach an additional 162,000 people.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Beyond water, we’re also making sure that Syrians get the assistance they need to get their daily amount of calories and nutrients. With inflation driving up food costs and many families often on the move, this is a constant challenge, and one area where we put a lot of our funding.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>But in many areas, there is room to grow. Literally. We’ve allocated a small but mighty portion of our ECHO funding to support over 500 families with vouchers for seeds and farming equipment to grow gardens on their land, adapting to the challenges of climate change and limited resources.</p>
