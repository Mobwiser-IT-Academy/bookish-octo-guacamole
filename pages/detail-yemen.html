        <h1>Conflict in Yemen</h1>
    </section>
    <p>Humanitarian info details</p>
    <p>What began as a response to peaceful protest in 2011 quickly became a protracted conflict and a complex humanitarian crisis. An exodus of 5.5 million refugees has ensued, along with over 6 million Syrians displaced within the country. As of December, 2020, 13 million Syrians still in-country are in need of humanitarian assistance, including 4.8 million children. The European Commission Joint Research Centreâ€™s INFORM Severity Index ranks Syria as the most severe humanitarian crisis as of December, 2020.</p>

        <li><a href="#">1 Increased conflict leading to additional displacement and instability</a></li>
            <li><a href="#">2 Declining value of the Syrian Pound, which has inflated food prices and increased levels of food insecurity</a></li>
            <li><a href="#">3 COVID-19 has closed borders, limiting both the work we can do and the ways we can measure the work we have done. Fortunately, we have been able to focus on one of the key areas of prevention in this pandemic, WASH.</a></li>

                <p>In response to the growing needs in the country, we recently partnered with fellow NGO ACTED (Agency for Technical Cooperation and Development) to design a program that focused on providing water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) services, along with some economic support to help with immediate needs.</p>

                <p>Over 10,000 Yemenites were supported in 2019 with nutrition education, focusing on maternal and child feeding. With 66 mother-to-mother support groups (totaling just over 1,050 members), rehabilitated latrines, and hygiene education, we have helped to help reduce incidents of diarrheal disease, especially among children. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>We work in partnership with organizations such as Welthungerhilfe to tackle malnutrition in Yemen. We seek to integrate malnutrition activities into our existing programs, particularly for our WASH and Livelihoods activities which are being implemented in the Yemen.</p>
