        <h1>Conflict in Congo</h1>
    </section>

    <p>Humanitarian info details</p>
    <p>Like Syria and Yemen, the timeline for the Democratic Republic of Congo is full of oppression, neglect, and unrest. The country suffered especially under the colonial rule of Belgium, and was set up for failure when it gained independence in 1960. Even with peace officially declared, violence has not gone away. Outbreaks of armed conflict have been triggered by land, natural resources, and ethnic disputes. </p>

    <ul>
        <li><a href="#">1 On top of continuing violence and instability  driven by armed groups in DRC’s east, a conflict has been exploding in the Kasai region, to the south of the country since August, 2016. The result is DRC’s latest large-scale humanitarian crisis.</a></li>
            <li><a href="#">2 In 2012, Jean-Pierre Pandi became chief of the Dibaya territory in Kasai — a stronghold of the main political opposition party. In DRC, chiefs hold a large amount of power and administrative control. While they aren’t political positions, they are recognized by the government. </a></li>
            <li><a href="#">3 Political tensions have escalated since President Joseph Kabila’s 11-year term ended in 2016. The son of the former president Laurent Kabila, he was the first to be democratically elected since 1960. Amid mounting pressure, growing opposition, and increasingly violent protests, Kabila stepped down in January 2019 and was succeeded by Félix Tshisekedi</a></li>

Most recently, we have deployed teams to respond to the emergency displacement situation in Beni and we are responding to a displacement crisis in Kasai. In addition, we have escalated our response to the DRC Ebola outbreak in North Kivu, which has become the second-largest Ebola outbreak on record. </p>
