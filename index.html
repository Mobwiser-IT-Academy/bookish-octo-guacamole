      <h3>1. The Syrian Crisis</h3>
      <a href="pages/detail-syria.html">Detail info here!</a>
      <p>Syria has spent much of the last century in and out of conflict. The latest influx began during the country’s own Arab Spring protests in 2011, which gave way to an ongoing civil war. The involvement of multiple nations and factions has further complicated the situation. Regardless of allegiance, so much violence means that civilians are paying the ultimate price, either with their lives or by abandoning their homes for life in exile.</p>

      <a href="pages/detail-yemen.html">Detail info here!</a>
      <p>The Yemeni Civil War has, according to one UN estimate, left nearly 80% of the country’s population in need of some form of assistance, and has damaged food systems, local infrastructure, the economy, and education prospects.</p>

      <h3>3. The Democratic republic of Congo</h3>
      <a href="pages/detail-congo.html">Detail info here!</a>
      <p>The 2017-20 Ebola outbreak in the DRC was the second-largest in history, and just one of the many aspects of the current state of humanitarian affairs in the country. A polio outbreak that began in 2018 is now an even bigger threat, as are the ongoing Horn of Africa locust invasion, regional drought, and devastating floods. 19.6 million Congolese require humanitarian assistance, nearly a 60% increase in need compared to last year’s report. </p>
